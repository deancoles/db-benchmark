runner.py
----------

This is the entry point for the Database Language Benchmark project.
At this early stage it serves as a placeholder to confirm that the
application can run successfully. 

Eventually, this script will:
- Load configuration settings
- Trigger the benchmarking workloads (insert, read, update, delete, mixed)
- Record results into CSV files for analysis
