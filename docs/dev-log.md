\- Created initial project structure (folders + .gitkeep).

\- Added full README with project overview.

\- First commit: "Initial structure".



\## 2025-08-24

\- Created runner.py with placeholder main() function and docstring.

\- Verified that the file runs successfully and prints a message.

\- Added `datasets/dataset\_generator.py` with a docstring and placeholder function.  

\- Function currently generates a list of sample records (e.g., “Record 1”, “Record 2”).  

\- Tested script by running it directly, confirmed it prints out sample data.  

\- Removed `.gitkeep` from `datasets/` and `docs/` since these folders now contain real files.  

\- Verified repo structure looks clean and functional.
